#  MapStruct Integration Project

This project demonstrates the use of **MapStruct**, a code generator that simplifies the implementation of mappings between **DTOs** and **Entities** in a Spring Boot application.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Automatic **DTO â†” Entity mapping** using MapStruct  
- Cleaner and faster alternative to **manual mapping**  
- Reduces **boilerplate code** in service and controller layers  
- Example mappings for **request and response DTOs**  
- Improves overall **code maintainability** and readability

## ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcome

Through this project, I practiced:  

- Efficient object mapping using **MapStruct**  
- Separating **API layer models (DTOs)** from **persistence layer entities**  
- Building a cleaner architecture by removing redundant code  
- Writing more maintainable and professional backend services
